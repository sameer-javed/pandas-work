# Python Pandas Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Python Pandas Projects** repository! This space contains a collection of my projects and scripts showcasing data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using the powerful **pandas** library in Python.

## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find various examples of using pandas for:
- Data wrangling and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Merging, grouping, and reshaping datasets
- Time series data manipulation
- Data visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

The projects here are intended for anyone interested in learning or improving their skills with pandas. They range from beginner-friendly exercises to more advanced data manipulation techniques.

## Projects Overview

1. **Project 1: Data Cleaning and Transformation**
   - Objective: Perform data cleaning on a real-world dataset, dealing with missing values, outliers, and data types.
   - Key Skills: Handling missing data, renaming columns, filtering data, and applying custom functions.

2. **Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Objective: Conduct a thorough analysis of a dataset to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns.
   - Key Skills: Descriptive statistics, visualization, pivot tables, and correlation analysis.

3. **Project 3: Time Series Analysis**
   - Objective: Analyze and visualize time-series data, identifying trends and seasonality.
   - Key Skills: Resampling, rolling averages, and time-series plotting.

More projects will be added over time, so stay tuned!
